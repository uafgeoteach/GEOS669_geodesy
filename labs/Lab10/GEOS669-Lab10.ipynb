    "### Introduction\n",

    "Today you will use some co-eruptive displacements from Redoubt volcano's 2009 eruption and hopefully learn a bit about its source. You will do 2 things: (1) implement the Mogi model, (2) find the best source parameters given the displacements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Caveats:\n",
    "\n",
    "(1) [I've already shown](http://www.grapenthin.org/download/Grapenthin_etal2012_Redoubt.pdf) that the Mogi source isn't the best model for the co-eruptive phase. We'll use it anyway for the data, because it's a simple model, and we're here to learn the methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "(2) The method I'll have you implement to solve for the non-linear parts is inefficient and imprecise. Again, it's one way to gain an intuition to find solutions to these problems; you should embark on a journey to learn about the many efficient non-linear methods / solvers that are out there yourself; often they take a parameter range in which they do their magic, which reduces to a single function call. Using this wouldn't result in much learning in a lab.\n",
    "\n",
    "I bring up these points to make sure you don't assume the methods used here are the ones you should use for the rest of your career; far from it! They're a starting point."
