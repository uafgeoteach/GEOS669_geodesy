For example, I (Emily Graves) would rename the notebook to `Graves_GEOS669-Lab2.ipynb`. You can do this by clicking on the filename in the top-left corner of this window (similar to, e.g., Google Docs). Download the completed file by checking its box in the JupyterHub file browser and selecting \"Download\" from the menu that appears or in the document's \"File\" menu under \"Download as\". Submit it to Canvas under the Lab 2 assignment **no later than 1pm September 15th**.\n",

    "We know that GPS coordinates are given in Earth-centered-Earth-fixed (ECEF) reference frame / coordinate system. However, those Cartesian coordinates are very hard to interpret and we need to be able to convert these back into ellipsoidal coordinates (and vice-versa). Today you'll be implementing two functions in this notebook that do exactly this. You will need these in the following labs for your conversions.\n",
