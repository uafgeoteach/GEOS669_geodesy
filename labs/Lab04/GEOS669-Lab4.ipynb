Download the completed file and image by checking its box in the JupyterHub file browser and selecting \"Download\" from the menu that appears or in the document's \"File\" menu under \"Download as\". Make a **zip file** with your last name and the lab number and then submit it to Canvas under the Lab 4 assignment **no later than 1pm October 4th**."

    "In an earlier lab, you went through the exercise of determining a position from pseudoranges; by hand. Good job! Today we will start using GIPSYx for precise positioning. GIPSYx (https://gipsy-oasis.jpl.nasa.gov/) is a collection of many programs and scripts to analyze GPS data (and other data). You can find them under ```/usr/local/GIPSY/GipsyX_current/bin```. All of these come with a ```help```, that displays when you call the program on the command line with the ```-h``` flag. The main command we will use is ```gd2e.py```.\n",

    "Summary: This is pretty straightforward GNSS processing. However, a few crucial things aren't treated well yet. That includes atmosphere, ocean loading, etc. Plus, it's pretty clumsy to do all of this by hand. What you'll do if you routinely process GNSS data from several stations that provide new data every day is decide on a processing strategy and then set up a few scripts that handle the downloading, preprocessing, analysis and time series updates. They can be run in an environment that triggers the processing pipeline at certain times of the day and -if all goes well- you have updated time series without doing much. Of course, there's always going to be something that will interfere with the ideal state, but still better than doing it all by hand ..."
