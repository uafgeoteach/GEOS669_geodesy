You can do this by clicking on the filename in the top-left corner of this window (similar to e.g. Google Docs). Download the completed file by checking its box in the JupyterHub file browser and selecting \"Download\" from the menu that appears or in the document's \"File\" menu under \"Download as\". Submit it to Canvas under the Lab 1 assignment **no later than 1pm September 8th**.\n"

The general syntax of Unix commands given in the man-pages is generally something like `command [options] file(s)`. This means you write the command name on the command line, you get to chose whether you want to use any of the options the command offers (square brackets usually indicate that things can be left out), and then you operate on one or more files.
