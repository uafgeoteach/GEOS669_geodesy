Please rename the notebook from `GEOS669-Lab6.ipynb` to `<last_name>_GEOS669-Lab6.ipynb`. For example, I (Emily Graves) would rename the notebook to `Graves_GEOS669-Lab6.ipynb`. You can do this by clicking on the filename in the top-left corner of this window (similar to, e.g., Google Docs). Download the completed file and images by checking its box in the JupyterHub file browser and selecting \"Download\" from the menu that appears or in the document's \"File\" menu under \"Download as\". **Then submit a zip file with the notebook and images to Canvas under the Lab 6 assignment no later than 1pm October 13th**."

    "Complete shift in gears now! We're moving from GPS processing into InSAR processing. The goal for today is to get you comfortable finding you way around the Alaska Satellite Facility's data portal, [Vertex](https://search.asf.alaska.edu/#/), using their free processing service, moving those data into opensarlab and performing a timeseries analysis on these data using [MintPy](https://github.com/insarlab/MintPy).\n",
    "\n",
    "A note of warning: there's a lot of vocabulary flying (ha!) around in InSAR processing. Most of these are standard satellite related terms. If there's something you don't understand, it's usually a good idea to search for the term, the satellite, and read up on it.\n",

It doesn't so much matter what the signal is as it does that it can be explored using InSAR, ideally this is large amplitude, in an arid region. This can or cannot be related to your graduate research projects. If you have an event in mind, find the time and location.\n",

    "### Step 2: Data Selection\n",
    "\n",
    "In Vertex, the top search tool bar allows you to set which dataset or satellite you search as well as an Area of Interest and additional filters for time and data type. If you are looking at a recent event (post-2014), leave the defaults in the search bar. On the map, zoom and pan to your Area of Interest (AOI). Use the click and drag mouse tool to define an AOI on the map. Select \"Search\" in the top search tool bar. One or more blue boxes will appear overlapping your AOI. These are Sentinel-1 SAR aquisition frames. Select a frame that completely covers your AOI (it should turn from red to blue). A bottom data window outlines the data associated with the selected frame. The \"Scene Detail\" menu provides satellite information such as the path and frame number, polarization, beam mode, and flight direction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Select \"SBAS\" from the bottom search tool. A new SBAS menu should appear. The number of pairs that will be generated is listed in the upper left corner. This is important. We would like to have around 100 pairs. \n",
    "\n",
    "On the right, a baseline image shows the SAR aquisitions plotted over time and baseline. The connecting black lines indicate pre-specified pairs. You can manually add additional pairs using the \"Custom Pair\" tool. Select the \"+\" and click on two SAR data points. A dotted line should appear between the two points. Add a few pairs to process that were not automatically generated. The number of pairs on the left should increase. Since this is set up as short baseline processing, add a few seasonal pairs that span from one year to another. In regions of low coherence, such as the northern regions with snowfall, seasonal pairs are necesary to determine deformation. \n",
    "\n",
    "You can adjust the number of pairs by sliding the baseline bar of the left of the image to adjust the pairs allowed baseline difference and the meter at the bottom of the days between aquisitions. You can set a dates filter under \"SBAS Criteria\"."
