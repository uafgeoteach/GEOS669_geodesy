# GEOSF669_geodesy

Supporting materials for GEOS 4/669 - Geodesy and Geodetic Methods at UAF

## Lab 01 - Introduction to Jupyter Notebooks
### Exercise 1

Log on to your OpenSARLab account and go to the Jupyter Hub main page. 

https://opensarlab.asf.alaska.edu/hub/login?next=%2Fhub%2F

On the upper right, click on the "New" drop down menu and select "Terminal". A terminal page should load in a new tab. **Keep both tabs open for the entire lab** Here the first thing you'll do is clone the Git directory for this course and for this lab:

```
git clone https://github.com/uafgeoteach/GEOS669_geodesy.git
```

Back on the main page (or the tab that contains the directory listing), you should now have a folder called `GEOS669_geodesy`. Go in this folder, under `labs` click on `Lab01` and open the lab called `GEOS669-Lab1.ipynb`. Follow the instructions and submit the assigment on Canvas before September 13th at 1 PM.
