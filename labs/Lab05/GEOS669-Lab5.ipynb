For example, I (Emily Graves) would rename the notebook to `Graves_GEOS669-Lab5.ipynb`. You can do this by clicking on the filename in the top-left corner of this window (similar to, e.g., Google Docs). Download the completed file and image by checking its box in the JupyterHub file browser and selecting \"Download\" from the menu that appears or in the document's \"File\" menu under \"Download as\". Then submit it to Canvas under the Lab 5 assignment **no later than 1pm October 11th**."

You absolutely should read the `gd2e.py` help to understand what each command line flag does! You will need to call it with the correct `doy` on the command line. Here are the main steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "- copy an ocean load coefficient file into a generic file name that gipsy expects for each site\n",
    "- convert the rinex file into a data-record file and run data editing (clock fixing, cycle slip fixing etc)\n",

Similar to the plots [here](https://spotlight.unavco.org/how-gps-works/gps-and-tectonics/gps-and-earthquakes.html). I am not particular about how you plot the vectors as long as the values are correct and you give me a scale vector that shows how long a vector needs to be for 10 cm of motion. Make sure your plots are included in the notebook you're submitting!"
